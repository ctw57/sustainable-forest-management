Technology and Forest Management Ideas

1.  Satellite Monitoring Satellite imagery can be used to monitor
    deforestation, track forest cover changes, and detect illegal
    logging activities in real time.

2.  Drones for Surveillance Drones equipped with cameras and sensors can
    survey large forest areas quickly, helping identify wildfires, pest
    outbreaks, and illegal activities.

3.  IoT Environmental Sensors Internet of Things (IoT) sensors can
    monitor soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and air quality to
    support better forest health management.

4.  AI for Fire Prediction Artificial intelligence models can analyze
    weather patterns and historical data to predict and prevent
    wildfires.

5.  GIS Mapping Systems Geographic Information Systems (GIS) help map
    forest resources, plan conservation efforts, and manage land use
    effectively.

6.  Mobile Reporting Apps Mobile applications can allow communities and
    rangers to report illegal logging, wildlife threats, or fire
    outbreaks instantly.

7.  Blockchain for Timber Tracking Blockchain technology can create
    transparent supply chains to verify sustainable and legal timber
    sourcing.

8.  Data Analytics for Biodiversity Tracking Data analysis tools can
    track wildlife populations and biodiversity trends to support
    conservation strategies.
